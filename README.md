# Bib-Builder

Holla,
This is Dwaipayan here. I have created this app as part of **MongoDB Atlas Hackathon on DEV, 2021-22 edition**.
Being involved in academic research, I have found that maintaining a bibliography becomes a real pain.
https://citation.crosscite.org/ has been a reliable companion ever since. So given the chance, I thought of an idea where we can leverage this wonderful resource along with maintaining a solid bibliography for the current project we get to work on.
This is a very initial draft and I wish to continue contributing to this project going forward.
In case anyone is interested about my research, following is the link
